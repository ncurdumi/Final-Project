          <h2>Grab a Divvy Bike</h2>
              <p>
                Divvy is Chicago's bikesharing program. It allows you to pick up a bike at one of many locations throughout
                the city and drop them off at another location. It's a great way to cover a lot of ground but still have time
                to take in your surroundings.
              </p>
              <p>
                Grab a bike from a station and head to the lakefront path!
              </p>
              <p>
                Divvy Bike locations and rates can be found on their <a href="https://www.divvybikes.com" target=_blank>website</a>.

              <p>
                Ride the scenic lakefront path south towards the city. As you ride, you'll see Lincoln Park on your right and
                Lake Michigan on your left. There are a number of spots along the way that make for great photo opportunities
                of the Chicago skyline.

                There are a few places that make for good stopping points along the lakefront path, but Oak Street Beach is our favorite.
                In addition to the beach itself, there is a large outdoor bar that's open in the summer and is great for relaxing with a view
                of the lake in front of you and the skyline behind you.

              <p>
                Continue your ride south and cross the bridge that spans the Chicago river. While on the brigdge, you can see the locks that allow boats to
                enter the river from Lake Michigan to the east, as well as Navy Pier and its large Ferris Wheel. To your right, you have a great view
                of the Chicago River and the downtown buildings that run along it.

                Continue your ride south, which will wind to the right towards large, open park land. Drop off your bike
                at the nearest Divvy station and take a walk through Maggie Daley Park, with its playgrounds and hills, over
                the winding pedestrian bridge and into Millenium Park. Millenium Park has the large, open air Pritzker Pavilion, beautiful
                Lurie Garden, rotating public art and home to the Bean, Chicago's most photographed
                attraction. The Art Institute is also nearby if you want to take a detour!
