              <p>
                <i>The lakefront can be accessed via pedestrian underpasses at Belmont, Barry or Diversey, and between Waveland and Addison or Roscoe and Aldine.</i>
              </P>
              <p>
                The lakefront along Lake Michigan is beautiful in any part of the city, but the stretch that borders
                Lakeview has some beautiful sights and amenities that are particularly worth visiting. For golfers, the 9-hole
                Sidney Marovitz course is a great short course right in the city, and the Diversey driving range is a great
                place to practice your swing. Softball fields and tennis courts are also available near Waveland avenue. And,
                of course, the Lakefront path provides fantastic views of the lake and city, particularly at the lake entrance
                to Belmont Harbor.

              <p>

              </p>
              <p>
                The home of the Chicago Cubs is the second oldest baseball stadium remaining in the country and a great place
                to watch a ballgame. Situated in the middle of the Wrigleyville area of Lakeview, it is surrounded by low-rise
                apartments and a lively stretch of bars and restaurants on Clark street. Our favorite seats in the stadium are in
                the 400 level, which give you a great elevated view of the action while still being close to the field, or in the bleachers,
                where the crowds tend to be a little rowdier.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether your're able to see a game or not, it's worth just walking around the neighborhood to get a feel for one
                of the most unique sport venue locations in the country. Even Sox fans like us can appreciate and enjoy it!

          <h2>Theaters</h2>
              <p>
                <i> Lakeview is home to a number of theaters as part of the <a href="http://btdchicago.com/">Belmont Theater District</a>, among others.</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether you want to see live concert or play, Lakeview is home to theaters of all types and sizes. The Vic Theater, near the
                Belmont CTA station, hosts major music acts in a small setting, as well as a brew-and-view series of recently released movies.
                The Playground and Annoyance theaters are great spots for off-the-beaten path (but high quality!) improv shows, and the Wit and 773
                theaters play host to unique plays and shows in intimate settings.
